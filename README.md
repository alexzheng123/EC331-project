## Overview

This study investigates the **weak form Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** in the Bitcoin market by analysing **1-minute BTC/USD data from 2024**. I apply both **traditional statistical tests** and **deep learning models**, including a novel **VMD-GRU-Attention** architecture.

Despite extensive volatility in Bitcoin prices, I find evidence of **predictable patterns**, especially when using the VMD-GRU-Attention model, challenging the weak form EMH.

## Research Questions

- Does the Bitcoin market in 2024 exhibit weak form efficiency?
- Can deep learning models forecast high-frequency Bitcoin returns more accurately than traditional econometric models?

## Key Findings

| Model                | Test MAE | Test RMSE |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Naïve Benchmark     | 0.0476   | 0.0749    |
| ARIMA               | 0.0476   | 0.0749    |
| GRU (basic)         | 0.0480   | 0.0749    |
| GRU (with macro/sentiment) | 0.0478 | 0.0749    |
| **VMD-GRU-Attention** | **0.0158** | **0.0239** |

The **VMD-GRU-Attention model** dramatically outperformed all others, indicating that short-term Bitcoin returns in 2024 are **not fully random**.
